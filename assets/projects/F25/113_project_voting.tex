\section{Description of the project}

\subsection*{Summary} For this project, you will conduct a %ranked-choice
survey with four choices for survey-takers to rank. You will calculate the winner using each of the  the
voting methods we have learned in this class, along with a new voting method that you create. Then you will discuss which method you think is the most fair to determine the winner for your survey, and why.
\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection*{Creating a survery and compiling results}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Create a survey of your own with 4 choices}. This can be an online survey using a platform like Survey
  Monkey, or you can make a paper ballot. The instructions on your survey should be clear, and you need to ask voters to rank the 4 options from best to worst. (In other words, this is a preference ballot.)
\item \emph{Collect results for your survey} from at least 25
    people.
\item \emph{Make a preference schedule} using your survey
  results.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection*{Create your own voting method}
Develop your own method of determining who wins your election. Carefully describe how to determine the winner using words someone who has not taken Math F113X can understand.

\subsection*{Determining the winners}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Determine the winner using the Plurality
      method}. Also determine who finished second, third, and fourth. Include work and supporting calculations.
      
  \item \emph{Determine the winner using Instant Runoff Voting}.
    Use the fewest number of last place votes to break any
    ties. Include work and supporting calculations. Clearly show all rounds, and clearly indicate (with words!) who is eliminated in each round.
  \item \emph{Determine the winner using Borda Count}.
    Also determine who finished second, third, and fourth. 
    Use the fewest number of last place votes to break any
    ties. Show your work and provide supporting calculations.
  \item \emph{Determine the winner using Copeland's
      method}. Also determine who finished second, third, and fourth. Show your work and provide supporting calculations.
  \item \emph{Determine the winner using your own original
      method}. For example, you could decide a winner using fewest
    last place votes, or an instant runoff voting system where the
    candidate with the most last place votes is eliminated. Clearly
    explain your method and show all your work.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Further Analysis}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 
Based on the objective of your survey, which of the voting
  methods you used do think is most fair overall? Which is the least
  fair? Write a short answer (1-2 paragraphs with at
  least 10 sentences total) explaining your conclusion. You should not be explaining how the methods work. Rather, you need to explain why the methods are the most fair or the least fair. You need to assess the fairness of all the methods that you used, including your own made up method.

%{\bf SUBMITTING YOUR PROJECT}

%\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Project Deliverables}

\subsection*{How to submit}
\begin{itemize}

\item Your project must have a \emph{Title Page},  containing your name and which project you are completing.

\item Your final project must be submitted in class during the final exam period. (Note that you can print out materials at the Student Success Center!)

\item Your final project must be typed.

\item You should use sentences to describe what each piece of your project is doing and what you are computing: one of your classmates should be able to read your project and understand what you are doing.

\item Your final project must be stapled together.
\end{itemize}

%{\bf 3 files} on Canvas format. Each file may contain multiple pages, but there should be precisely three files uploaded.
\subsection*{What to submit}

Your final project will have the following sections. Each section should start on a separate page.

\begin{enumerate}

\item A section titled \emph{Survey} that describes 
\be
\item What you were trying to determine using your Survey
\item A copy of the survey question
\item Your complete preference schedule
\ee

\item A section titled \emph{My New Voting Method} that clearly describes your new voting method, using words that someone who has not taken Math F113X can understand.

\item A  section titled \emph{Winners} containing:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Your preference schedule
  \item The winner using the \emph{Plurality} method, with supporting work
  \item The winner using \emph{Instant Runoff Voting}, with supporting work 
  \item The winner using \emph{Borda Count}, with supporting work
  \item The winner using \emph{Copeland's Method}, with supporting work
  \item The winner determined using your \emph{own voting method} along with your results and supporting work
  \end{itemize}
  
  Each subsection above should be indicated with a clear heading.
  
\item A section titled \emph{Best Method} containing your answer, with justification, to
  the following question: 
  \begin{quote}``Which of the voting methods you used do you think is
  most fair overall? Which is the least fair?'' \end{quote}
You should assess the overall fairness of each of the five methods you used above. For each method, discuss its strengths and weaknesses. Then determine which method you think is the most fair and which you think is the least fair.

\item A section titled \emph{Survey Results} that shows the results of each voter's
  preference ballot. You may present these raw results using a table or spreadsheet, or include the actual ballots.

\end{enumerate}
