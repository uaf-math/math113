\emph{\large{Topics \& Student Learning Outcomes}}

 This course is listed as a General Education Math Course. As such,
 this course is expected to meet the following general learning outcomes.

 At the completion of the course, students will:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Build knowledge of human institutions, sociocultural processes, and the physical and
   natural works through the study of mathematics. Competence will be demonstrated for
   the foundational information in each subject area, its context and significance, and the
   methods used in advancing each.
 \item Develop intellectual and practical skills across the curriculum, including inquiry and
   analysis, critical and creative thinking, problem solving, written and oral communication,
   information literacy, technological competence, and collaborative learning. Proficiency
   will be demonstrated across the curriculum through critical analysis of proffered
   information, well-reasoned solutions to problems or inferences drawn from evidence,
   effective written and oral communication, and satisfactory outcomes of group projects.
 \end{enumerate}

The subject areas covered in this course include voting theory, weighted voting theory, methods of fair division, graph theory, scheduling, cryptography, modeling growth, and applications of modeling to finance.

\heading{Evaluation and Grades}
Grades are determined as follows.  (Each component of the grade is discussed below.)
 
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Participation & 6\%\\
\hline
Homework & 10\% \\
\hline
Miniquizzes & 16\% \\
\hline
Midterm Exams (3) & 3 $\times$ 16\% $=$ 48\% \\
\hline
Final Course Project & 20\% \\
\hline
{\bf total} & {\bf 100\%} \, \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\hspace{1cm}
%\textcolor{red}{
\begin{tabular}{llll}
A  & 93--100\%& C  & 73-76\%  \\
A$-$ & 90--92\% & C$-$ & 70-72\% \\

B  & 83--86\% & D  & 63-66\%  \\
B$-$& 80--82\% & D$-$ & 60-62\%  \\
C+ & 77-79\% & F  & $<$ 60\%
\end{tabular}
%}
\end{multicols}

%\textcolor{red}{I returned the letter-grade-intervals to the typical ones and NOT the dropped ones. Of course, we have the right to drop them but I would prefer not to state that in advance. Especially as we have implemented so many ways of bumping up the grade already.}

\heading{Participation in Classroom Activities}
During some class periods, there will be a worksheet or short activity
to be completed in class. These are cooperative assignments meant to
be completed with your neighbors. As these are intended for practice
more than evaluation, effort and completion will count towards a
significant portion of your grade, but accuracy does matter!
{\bf Participation and completion of Classroom Activities will make up 6\% of the overall course
grade.}

%\textcolor{red}{I think our timing about homework, quizzes/midterms is off by a little bit. Here is my point. I think that if homework is due Monday, we want miniquizzes on Wednesday, not Friday. Also, I think that it's better to have assessments like quizzes and midterms on Wednesdays as it decreases the number of makeups due to (often justifiable) long weekends. My preference would be HW on Monday, with grace to Wed. Quizzes/Midterms on Wednesday. Otherwise, we have HW on Wed, grace to Fri and Quizzes and Midterms on Friday. 
%What do you think?}

%\textcolor{blue}{ I think this would blow up the schedule we've got laid out....at least for the exams. I don't have a problem with HW being due on Monday and miniquizzes on Friday, although I see the lack of desirability. I don't feel amazingly strongly about this, but right now the scheudle has us finish a unit, and then take the exam. If we moved exams to wednesdays we would be two days off on everything...}

%\textcolor{blue}{Proposal for grading activities: Students turn in the activities at the end of class, and we keep a spreadsheet in Google like we did for calculus and hand-add the activities in there. I don't want ~40 activities junking up either gradescope or the canvas gradebook.}

\heading{Homework}
Throughout the semester, there will be weekly written homework assignments. Each assignment will be
due Mondays at 11:59pm on Canvas.  As with Classroom Activities,
these are intended for practice. Solutions to the homework problems will be provided in advance so that you will be able to:\\
(1) check your work\\
(2) identify what you do not understand, and \\
(3) get help resolving misunderstanding.\\
Effort and
completion will count towards a significant portion of your grade, but
accuracy does matter, as do organization and neatness. See the \textbf{Homework Guidelines} for detailed information about how your homework should be written.
{\bf Homework will make up 10\% of the overall course
grade.}

\heading{Miniquizzes}
On most {Fridays}, if there is not a midterm, we will have a miniquiz over some topic from the homework that was due Monday. Each miniquiz will be given in the last 20 minutes of class. You will have 10 minutes to complete the quiz independently using only a nonprogrammable calculator, no notes. In the last 10 minutes of class, you will have the opportunity to correct your quiz with the help of your notes, your book, your classmates, and your instructor. Miniquizzes will be graded on correctness but you will have the chance to get half of the points back for clearly identifying any mistakes and supplying detailed correct answers. {\bf Miniquizzes will make up 16\% of the overall course
grade.}


\heading{Midterm Exams}
There are 3 midterm exams to be taken on {\bf Friday, 14 February},
{\bf Friday, 28 March}, and {\bf Friday, 25 April} during our normal class period. Each of
these midterm exams will be 1 hour and will consist of 100 points. These midterm exams are
NOT cumulative; they will only test the material that has been covered since the previous
midterm exam. Non-programmable calculators will be allowed on these exams. Make-up
midterms will be given only for documented excused absences.
{\bf Each midterm exam is worth 16\% of the overall course grade for a total of 48\% of the course grade.}

%\textcolor{blue}{LWB: I would be in favor of allowing students to use a 3''x5'' notecard and a scientific calculator (since we say they need one above) on exams, and a calculator on miniquizzes.}

\subheading{Test Corrections Policy}
For each of the three midterm exams, students who score less than 90\% will be allowed a
chance for exam corrections to improve their exam grade. A student can earn up to 40\% of missed points for correcting their work, up to a maximum total score of 90\%.

\newpage

{\it For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it A student who scores {\bf 50} out of 100 points may
correct all 50 points they missed and receive {\bf 20} points for
corrections, giving them a combined score of {\bf 70} points.}
\item {\it A student who scores {\bf 89} out of 100 points may
correct all 11 points they missed but will only receive {\bf 1} point
for
corrections, capping their combined score at {\bf 90} points.}
\end{itemize}
}

Corrections are due one week after the graded exams are returned.


\heading{Final Course Project}
At the end of the semester, instead of taking a final exam, students will need to submit a Final
Course Project by following the instructions posted in the “Final Course Project” assignment on
Canvas. Each of the project options is based on a topic that will be covered in this course.
Students will have the entire semester to complete the project; the projects are due during finals
week on {\bf Wednesday, 30 April}. Students will need to choose their project topic by
{\bf Wednesday, 19 March}. {\bf The final course project will count for 20\% of the overall course grade}.

\heading{Tutoring and Resources}
\vskip -30pt\strut
\begin{clist}
    \item The Math and Stat Lab is located in the 
      student success center on the 6th floor of the Rassmussen Building and
      offers drop-in tutoring.

	See 	\href{http://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}{\texttt{www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}} for schedules and availability.
	\item Free
one-on-one (or small group) tutoring is available in 
Chapman Building Room 201. You must schedule an
appointment; see \href{http://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}{\texttt{www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}}.
\item The Student Success Center has {\it Academic Coaches}, which are undergraduate students who can help you  improve your study strategies, identify resources and set goals, offer assistance with personalized study plans, time management,  navigating UAF technology, test and note-taking strategies, and much more. You can talk to Academic Coaches by dropping into their area in the Student Success Center on the 6th floor of the Rasmuson Library.
	\item Student Support Services (\href{https://uaf.edu/sss/}{\texttt{uaf.edu/sss/}}) offers free tutoring in many subjects to students who qualify for their program.
	\item ASUAF (\href{https://uaf.edu/asuaf/}{\texttt{uaf.edu/asuaf/}}) offers private tutoring for a small fee, based on student income.
\end{clist}



 \heading{AI usage}
During proctored and on-paper miniquizzes and exams you will not have access to electronic tools of any type, and you may not use books or notes\textcolor{blue}{, except as announced}.  These assessments represent 84\% of your grade.

Feel free to use a calculator or outside resources on homework.  It is also reasonable to explore new AI tools like ChatGPT, but how you guide your prompts and verify the results is what matters.  Merely doing cut and paste without understanding will have no benefit.  Noting that miniquizzes and exams represent the vast majority of your grade, your own thinking, as you do the homework, has the greatest benefits.


\heading{Rules and Policies}
\vskip -20pt

\subheading{Incomplete Grade} 
Incomplete (I) will only be given in
  DMS courses in cases where
  the student has completed the majority (normally all but the last
  three weeks) of a course with a grade of C or better, but for
  personal reasons beyond his/her control has been unable to complete
  the course during the regular term. Negligence or indifference are
  not acceptable reasons for the granting of an incomplete. 

%\subheading{Late Withdrawals} 
%A withdrawal after the deadline from a DMS course will normally be granted only in cases where the student is performing satisfactorily (i.e., C or better) in a course, but has exceptional reasons, beyond his/her control, for being unable to complete the course. To apply for a late withdrawal, please talk to your instructor and your advisor.%These exceptional reasons should be detailed in writing tothe instructor, department head and dean.

\subheading{No Early Final Examinations}
Final examinations for DMS
  courses shall not be held earlier than the date and time published
  in the official term schedule. Normally, a student will not be
  allowed to take a final exam early. Exceptions can be made by
  individual instructors, but should only be allowed in exceptional
  circumstances and in a manner which doesn't endanger the security of
  the exam.

\subheading{Academic Dishonesty}
Academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, will not
be tolerated.  It is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct
and will be punished according to UAF procedures.

\subheading{Student protections and services statement}
Every qualified student is welcome in my classroom.  As needed, I am happy to work with you, Disability Services, Veterans' Services, Rural Student Services, etc.~to find reasonable accommodations.  Students at this University are protected against sexual harassment and discrimination (Title IX), and minors have additional protections.  As required, if I notice or am informed of certain types of misconduct, then I am required to report it to the appropriate authorities.
