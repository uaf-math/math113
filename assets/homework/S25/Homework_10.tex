Remember to write up your homework solutions according to the homework writeup guidelines. 

Homework is graded using the following rubric for each problem (or problem part):

\begin{description}
\item[2 points:] You provided a complete answer, with supporting work, written up clearly
\item[1 point:] Some attempt at a solution, but incomplete writeup / unclear / illegible / no answer
\item[1 point:] Only an answer, with no supporting work 
\item[0 points:] Missing.
\end{description}

After you do the homework, you need to check your answers against the solutions! Then figure out your errors (if any) and revise your homework before you submit it. Finally, answer the reflection question.

Homework must be submitted on Gradescope.
